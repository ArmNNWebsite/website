## Code Reviews

Contributions to the machine learning platform must go through code review. Code reviews are performed through the [mlplatform.org Gerrit server](https://review.mlplatform.org/). Contributors must sign up to this server with their GitHub account credentials.

Only reviewed contributions can go to the master branch of any of the machine learning platform repositories.

## Continuous Integration

Contributions to machine learning platform codebases go through testing at the Arm CI system. All unit, integration and regression
tests must pass before a contribution will be merged to a repository’s master branch.


## Release Policy

The machine learning platform projects will be released every three months in February, May, August and November, see [Releases](/releases/) for details of the latest updates.

## Communications

We encourage all developers to subscribe to one or all of the [machine learning platform mailing lists](/mailing-lists/).
