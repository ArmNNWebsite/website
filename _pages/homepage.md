            The machine learning platform is part of the [Linaro Artificial Intelligence Initiative](https://www.linaro.org/news/linaro-announces-launch-of-machine-intelligence-initiative/) and is the home for Arm NN and Arm Compute Library – open-source software libraries that optimise the execution of machine learning (ML) workloads on Arm-based processors.

            It enables a new era of advanced, ultra-efficient inference at the edge. Specifically designed for machine learning and 
            neural network (NN) capabilities, the architecture is versatile enough to scale to any device, from the Internet of 
            Things (IoT) to connected cars and servers.

            The machine learning platform libraries – Arm NN and Arm Compute Library – bridge the gap between existing neural network (NN) frameworks, such as TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite, Caffe and ONNX, and the underlying IP.

            They enable efficient translation of these NN frameworks, allowing them to run efficiently – without modification – across Arm Cortex-A CPUs, Arm Mali GPUs and the Arm ML processor.
